# Improving-Deployment-Speed-and-Reducing-Production-Issues-with-DevOps-Practices-Deployment-Code

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to improve deployment speed and reduce production issues using DevOps practices like containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes orchestration. It features a simple Flask application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using Docker and automated via GitHub Actions.

🧩 Features

✅ Fast and reliable deployments with CI/CD✅ Containerized application ensuring environment consistency✅ Kubernetes-based scalability and high availability✅ Automated build, push, and deploy pipeline✅ Easy rollback mechanisms and proactive monitoring support

🏗️ Prerequisites

Docker installed

Kubectl installed and configured

Access to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service)

GitHub account with repository access

DockerHub account for container image storage

⚙️ Setup and Deployment Guide

📝 Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

🐍 Step 2: Run the Application Locally (Optional)

pip install -r app/requirements.txt
python app/app.py  # Access at http://localhost:5000

🐳 Step 3: Build and Run Docker Container

docker build -t devops-app:latest .
docker run -p 5000:5000 devops-app:latest

☸️ Step 4: Deploy to Kubernetes

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
kubectl get svc  # Retrieve the external IP to access the app

🚦 CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Create GitHub Repository and push the project files.

Add Repository Secrets under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

DOCKER_USERNAME: yuktha.

DOCKER_PASSWORD: #####.

Trigger Deployment: Push to the main branch to initiate the automated pipeline.

🔎 Accessing the Application

After deployment, find the external IP of the Kubernetes service:

kubectl get svc devops-app-service

Visit http://<external-ip> to see:

Hello, DevOps World!

📊 Best Practices Followed

✅ Small, frequent deployments for minimal risks✅ Automated testing and rollbacks to avoid production issues✅ Containerized environments for consistency✅ Scalable architecture with Kubernetes✅ Secure handling of credentials via GitHub Secrets
